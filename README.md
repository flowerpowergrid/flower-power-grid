# Flower Power Grid (FPG)

Flower Power Grid (FPG) is a modular, 3D-printable wall system designed to turn empty wall space into usable, flexible structure.

This repository marks the beginning of the Flower Power Grid project.

---

## Project status

Flower Power Grid is currently under active development.  
Parts will be released gradually as they are finalized and tested.

---

## What is included (currently)

- FPG Mini – Mounting Spacer

This part is a foundational component for the Flower Power Grid system.

---

## Design philosophy

- Reliable printing on a wide range of 3D printers  
- Tolerant to common print issues  
- Simple, robust geometry  
- Modular and expandable  

The goal is a system that works without printer-specific tuning.

## Repository structure

Printable STL files are organized by system size:

- **FPG-Mini** – compact system for small spaces and light to medium loads  
- **FPG-Midi** – medium-sized system (planned)  
- **FPG-Maxi** – large and heavy-duty system (planned)

Each size contains its own folders for grid parts, spacers, caps and adapters.

If you are new to GitHub:  
Simply open the folder matching your system size and download the STL files you need.
