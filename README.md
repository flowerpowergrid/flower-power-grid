# Flower Power Grid (FPG)

Flower Power Grid (FPG) is a modular, 3D-printable wall system designed to turn empty wall space into usable, flexible structure.

This repository marks the beginning of the Flower Power Grid project.

---

## Project status

Flower Power Grid is currently under active development.  
Parts will be released gradually as they are finalized and tested.

---

## Development approach

Flower Power Grid is developed as a coherent system.

New parts are continuously designed, tested and refined before being released.  
Because all components interact with each other, compatibility and reliability are essential. Nothing is published unless it works cleanly within the system and meets the intended level of functionality.

There is no fixed release schedule and no promises of future parts.  
Development is driven by testing, iteration and real-world use. Released components are the result of this process.

## Design philosophy

- Reliable printing on a wide range of 3D printers  
- Tolerant to common print issues  
- Simple, robust geometry  
- Modular and expandable  

The goal is a system that works without printer-specific tuning.

## Repository structure

Printable STL files are organized by system size:

- **FPG-Mini** – compact system for small spaces and light to medium loads  
- **FPG-Midi** – medium-sized system (planned)  
- **FPG-Maxi** – large and heavy-duty system (planned)

Each size contains its own folders for grid parts, spacers, caps and adapters.

If you are new to GitHub:  
Simply open the folder matching your system size and download the STL files you need.
