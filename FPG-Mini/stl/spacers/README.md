## FPG Mini – Spacers

Spacers are optional mounting parts used to create distance between the Flower Power Grid and the mounting surface.

They are recommended when:
- compensating for uneven walls or other surfaces
- routing cables or LED strips behind the grid
- increasing stability for certain add-ons

Multiple spacers can be combined.  
They are designed to interlock with each other, providing a clean, aligned stack and allowing the distance to the mounting surface to be increased in defined increments.

If mounted directly to a flat surface, spacers are optional.
