## FPG Mini – Spacers

Spacers are optional mounting parts used to create distance between the Flower Power Grid and the mounting surface.

They are recommended when:
- compensating for uneven walls or other surfaces
- routing cables or LED strips behind the grid
- increasing stability for certain add-ons

If mounted directly to a flat surface, spacers are optional.
