## FPG Mini – Frames

Frames are optional finishing parts for the Flower Power Grid system.

They are used to create a clean and intentional outer edge when a grid does not continue in all directions. Frames visually close the grid, improve the overall appearance and help the system look complete and integrated.

Frames also allow the grid to form a clear rectangular outer shape.  
Without frames, triangular and hexagonal patterns naturally result in irregular edges, which can be visually challenging in many applications. Frames solve this by defining a calm, straight boundary around the system.

Frames are recommended for:
- standalone grid installations
- visible edges and corners
- presentation, living spaces or decorative setups

Using frames is optional, but they are an important part of achieving a finished and balanced look.
