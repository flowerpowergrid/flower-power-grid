## FPG Mini – Fill Tiles

Fill tiles are non-functional parts used to fill grid cells and shape the visual appearance of the Flower Power Grid.

They invite individual customization and can be printed and combined in any color.  
Together with the caps, fill tiles visually cover the entire grid structure in the background, resulting in a clean, uniform and finished surface.

Fill tiles can be used to create subtle or highly expressive designs.  
By combining different colors and tile shapes, it is possible to form patterns, gradients or pixel-art-style images that span across the grid and draw attention.

Depending on their design, fill tiles may cover single grid cells or extend across multiple cells.  
They do not provide mounting or load-bearing functionality and are intended purely for visual composition.
