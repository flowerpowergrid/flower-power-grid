## FPG Mini – Caps

Caps are parts used at the grid nodes and sit flush with the front surface of the grid, aligned with the front face of add-ons.

Their primary function is to connect and secure grid tiles at the node points.  
They are recommended wherever separate grid tiles are joined together, regardless of whether a wall screw is present or not.

Caps are not strictly required for node points located entirely within a single grid tile.  
However, they contribute significantly to the structural stability of connected tiles and help prevent movement between them.

In addition to their structural role, caps create a clean and consistent visual appearance across the entire grid surface.

### Cap variants

There are two types of caps.  
Both variants share the same dimensions and fulfill the same structural purpose.

- **Closed cap**  
  Covers the grid node completely and is used where no access to the mounting screw is required.

- **Open cap (with center hole)**  
  Allows access to the mounting screw without removing the cap.  
  This variant is particularly suited for applications where the system is mounted and dismounted frequently, such as trade shows, exhibition spaces or temporary installations.

The open cap visually covers the grid node while enabling faster installation and removal of the entire system.
