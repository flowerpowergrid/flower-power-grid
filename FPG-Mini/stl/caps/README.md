## FPG Mini – Caps

Caps are parts used at the grid nodes and sit flush with the front surface of the grid, aligned with the front face of add-ons.

Their primary function is to connect and secure grid tiles at the node points.  
They are recommended wherever separate grid tiles are joined together, regardless of whether a wall screw is present or not.

Caps are not strictly required for node points located entirely within a single grid tile.  
However, they contribute significantly to the structural stability of connected tiles and help prevent movement between them.

In addition to their functional role, caps create a clean and consistent visual appearance across the entire grid surface.  
They can also be used to cover mounting points when no screw is installed.
