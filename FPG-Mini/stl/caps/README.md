## FPG Mini – Caps

Caps are parts used at the grid nodes and sit flush with the front surface of the grid, aligned with the front face of add-ons.

Their primary function is to connect and secure grid tiles at the node points.  
They are recommended wherever separate grid tiles are joined together, regardless of whether a wall screw is present or not.

Caps are not strictly required for node points located entirely within a single grid tile.  
However, they contribute significantly to the structural stability of connected tiles and help prevent movement between them.

In addition to their structural role, caps create a clean and consistent visual appearance across the entire grid surface.

### Cap variants

Several cap variants are available.  
All variants share the same basic dimensions and fulfill the same structural purpose, while addressing different positions within the grid layout.

---

### Closed Cap

The Closed Cap fully covers the grid node and is used where no access to the mounting screw is required.

---

### Open Cap (with center hole)

The Open Cap allows access to the mounting screw without removing the cap.  
This variant is particularly suited for applications where the system is mounted and dismounted frequently, such as trade shows, exhibition spaces or temporary installations.

It visually covers the grid node while enabling faster installation and removal of the entire system.

### Half Cap

The Half Cap is a reduced version of the standard cap.

It is used at the top and bottom edges of the grid to create a clean and intentional vertical finish.  
When frames are installed on the left and right sides of the grid to form a rectangular outer shape, the Half Cap completes the system at the remaining open edges.

---

### Corner Cap

The Corner Cap is designed for the four outer corner positions of the rectangular grid layout created by frame installation.

It is used in combination with frames and provides a clean and defined finish where horizontal and vertical edges meet.  
The Corner Cap completes the rectangular outer structure of the system, independent of the exact internal grid geometry.
